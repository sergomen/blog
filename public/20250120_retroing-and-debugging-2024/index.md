In 2024, I didn't achieve anything significant.

I had planned to find my first job as a JavaScript developer (I started taking Web Development seriously in 2022), but no one called me because I lack commercial experience.

I send my resume every day, but I haven't had a single interview yet.

That's why I often think that since "nobody needs me," I'll hire myself and start my own startup. However, during this time, I've accumulated a bunch of different personal projects that showed me they're incapable of attracting an audience of more than 10 people. Monetization isn't even a question here.

But in 2024, I learned how to paint walls, hang and connect chandeliers to the electrical system. I learned how to calculate capacities and set up Internet connections in the absence of electricity. I read my first book in English, and now I'm reading "The Lord of the Rings." I also created a couple of projects using Node.js and learned its basics.

By the way, my own personal project [LifeEvent](https://lifevent.vercel.app/), which I developed in 2023, helped me remember some events from the past year. However, few people appreciated it. Maybe I advertised it poorly, or perhaps it really isn't that great. Still, something tells me I need to return to it. After all, I have 2025 ahead of me, in which I plan to catch up and accomplish a lot.

Overall, 2024 reminded me not to give up and reinforced my belief that I can learn or do whatever I set my mind to. You just need to be able to concentrate and love what you do.

I realized that you don't need to publish an MVP that nobody is interested in. I also realized that you shouldn't create projects for others, expecting them to like it. They'll most likely pass you by, and you'll burn out. You need to make projects solely for yourself, for your own satisfaction, or to solve problems that concern your mind and heart. At least this way, you'll be satisfied with the work you've done.
